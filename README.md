# Heavy Metal
### A MacOS app to prototype Metal shaders and kernels

#### Goals

The idea is to use this app to have a framework to quickly write and test shaders and kernels, and Generative Art is also great to study the capabilties of Metal, since you can use all the functions in the standard library and pass information back and forth, with future applications to any kind of image or video processing.

#### Sample Output

This is a screenshot of a render result.
